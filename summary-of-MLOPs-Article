# Architectural Design Decisions for the Machine Learning Workflow Summary

In the introduction of this article, the authors started from comparing Software Engineering (SE) and Machine Learning (ML) communities. Reading this article we can realize the differences between the two communities. This discrepancy could be partially explained by the fact that ML developers usually do not have a software engineering background, while software engineers usually know nothing about ML projects or what ML engineers face when they try to solve a problem.

The Machine Learning Workflow looks kinda simple. The ML engineer mission is to create, train and evaluate your model. To accomplish that, they must put their model in a server, just like an API, and wait for a trigger. When this trigger is pulled, their system must consume and process data from trigger, and extract the features from data. The features and data are then passed to the model and that's when model starts training. When training is finished, the model is deployed, which means that the model is ready for making predictions.

There are several methods and designs that a ML engineer can choose from to create a ML solution. This is mainly because there is no "universal best way" to extract and process data. Likewise, there is no such thing as a "universal best model" in ML solutions. Thus, ML engineers must test as many architectures and designs as possible in order to discover the “best local design(s) and architecture(s)”. To be more espoecific, the authors say there are about 10 design decisions a ML engineer must answer and each decision have more or less than four options.

To simplify the problem, we can divide it in two other problems: Data processing and Model building. First one can be divided in smaller problems, just like "Data processing automation decision", "Data processing tasks decision", "Feature persistence and access decision", "Data processing in batches or in real-time
decision", "Data ingestion decision" and "Data ingestion decision". While Model Building can be divided into "Model building decision", "Model building tasks decision", "When and how to train the model decision" and "AutoML".

The conclusion is there are many decisions a ML engineer must take to create a ML solution. This article modeled practitioner practices, ADDs, and decision drivers in the field of Software Engineering/Architecture for Machine Learning. As the authors said in the article:

*The resulting ADD model can help researchers better understand practitioners’ needs and the challenges they face, and guide their decisions based on existing practices.*


Obviously the authors explained each decision cited before, but if I talk about all that decisions, this summary would turn into another paper (100% sure it would be worst than the original hahaha). So if you get interested, take a look in the original paper cited in the end of this file. Stay safe and have a nice day!
